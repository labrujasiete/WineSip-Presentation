# WineSip App

## Overview

This Flutter project is currently in development and aims to simplify the process of wine tasting and note-taking by providing an elegant and user-friendly experience. The app utilizes several key technologies and features:

- **Authentication:** Google login functionality is already implemented, allowing users to log in using their Google accounts. Support for other common social networks is still pending.

- **State Management:** The app uses the Provider package as a state manager, ensuring efficient and organized state management throughout the application.

- **Backend:** The functionality of the app relies heavily on Firebase, including Firebase Firestore for data storage and Firebase Storage for handling media assets.

## Features

### Wine Tasting Experience

The primary focus of this mobile application is to enhance the depth and precision of flavor descriptions during wine tasting. It achieves this through the following features:

1. **Five-Step Sliders:** Intuitive five-step sliders are provided for key wine traits, including:
   - Body
   - Sweetness
   - Tannins
   - Acidity
   - Alcohol

2. **Aroma Descriptions:** Visually appealing, square-shaped buttons display a variety of wine aromas, each accompanied by relevant icons. Users can select and describe the aromas they perceive during wine tasting.

3. **Grape Variety Selector:** Our app also features a comprehensive grape variety selector to assist users in identifying and recording the wines they taste. By providing this broad range of properties and flavor descriptions, we empower wine enthusiasts to express their tasting experiences more accurately and vividly.

   These detailed notes are not only for personal reference but can also be shared with others, fostering a community of wine enthusiasts who can better understand and appreciate each other's unique perspectives on various wines.



## Development Progress

- Google login functionality is complete.
- Support for other common social networks is pending.
- State management using Provider is implemented and organized.
- Firebase Firestore is used for storing and managing wine-related data.
- Firebase Storage is utilized for handling media assets.


## Future Development

In the future, we have ambitious plans to further enhance the Wine Tasting App with advanced features that cater to wine connoisseurs and enthusiasts:

### Wine Label Recognition

We envision implementing a cutting-edge Wine Label Recognition API. Users will be able to simply take a picture of a wine label, and the app will use image recognition technology to identify the wine, providing users with detailed information about the wine's origin, grape variety, and more. This feature will bring a new level of convenience and expertise to wine tasting.

### Speech to Text Integration

Another exciting development on our roadmap is the integration of Speech to Text functionality. Users will have the option to verbally describe their wine tasting experiences, and the app will transcribe their spoken words into text. This feature will save time and make it easier for users to record their thoughts and impressions while tasting various wines.

### Feedback Section

We plan to introduce a feedback section where users can share their thoughts and opinions on news and interests related to wine. Users will also have the opportunity to rate and review wine profiles. This feature will encourage engagement and interaction within the wine enthusiast community.

### Social Sharing

To expand the app's social reach, we intend to add a feature that allows users to share their wine profiles and tasting experiences on popular social networks. This will enable users to showcase their wine discoveries and connect with fellow wine enthusiasts beyond the app.
